Raw stream interface.  




## Method list:
* `read(): \Promise Resolves with a string when new data is available or `null` if the stream has closed.`
* `write(string $data): \Promise Succeeds once the data has been successfully written to the stream.`
* `end(string $finalData): \Promise Succeeds once the data has been successfully written to the stream.`
* `connect(\danog\MadelineProto\Stream\ConnectionContext $ctx): \Generator`
* `disconnect(): void`
* `getSocket(): \Amp\Socket\EncryptableSocket`

## Methods:
### `read(): \Promise Resolves with a string when new data is available or `null` if the stream has closed.`

Reads data from the stream.


Return value: Resolves with a string when new data is available or `null` if the stream has closed.

### `end(string $finalData): \Promise Succeeds once the data has been successfully written to the stream.`

Marks the stream as no longer writable. Optionally writes a final data chunk before. Note that this is not the
same as forcefully closing the stream. This method waits for all pending writes to complete before closing the
stream. Socket streams implementing this interface should only close the writable side of the stream.


Parameters:
* `$finalData`: `string` Bytes to write.  


Return value: Succeeds once the data has been successfully written to the stream.

AES CTR stream wrapper.  

Manages AES CTR encryption/decryption


## Method list:
* `connect(\danog\MadelineProto\Stream\ConnectionContext $ctx): \Generator`
* `disconnect(): \Amp\Promise`
* `getWriteBufferGenerator(int $length): \Generator`
* `getReadBufferGenerator(int $length): \Generator`
* `bufferReadGenerator(\Amp\Promise $promise): \Generator That resolves with a string when the provided promise is resolved and the data is decrypted`
* `bufferWrite(string $data): \Promise Succeeds once the data has been successfully written to the stream.`
* `setExtra(array $data): void`
* `getSocket(): \Amp\Socket\EncryptableSocket`
* `getStream(): \danog\MadelineProto\Stream\RawStreamInterface`
* `getReadBuffer(int $length): \Amp\Promise`
* `getWriteBuffer(int $length, string $append): \Amp\Promise`

## Methods:
### `connect(\danog\MadelineProto\Stream\ConnectionContext $ctx): \Generator`

Connect to stream.


Parameters:
* `$ctx`: `\danog\MadelineProto\Stream\ConnectionContext` The connection context  


#### See also: 
* [`\danog\MadelineProto\Stream\ConnectionContext`: Connection context class.](../ConnectionContext.md)
* `\Generator`




### `disconnect(): \Amp\Promise`

Async close.


#### See also: 
* `\Amp\Promise`




### `getWriteBufferGenerator(int $length): \Generator`

Get write buffer asynchronously.


Parameters:
* `$length`: `int` Length of data that is going to be written to the write buffer  


#### See also: 
* `\Generator`




### `getReadBufferGenerator(int $length): \Generator`

Get read buffer asynchronously.


Parameters:
* `$length`: `int` Length of payload, as detected by this layer  


#### See also: 
* `\Generator`




### `bufferReadGenerator(\Amp\Promise $promise): \Generator That resolves with a string when the provided promise is resolved and the data is decrypted`

Decrypts read data asynchronously.


Parameters:
* `$promise`: `\Amp\Promise` Promise that resolves with a string when new data is available or `null` if the stream has closed.  


Return value: That resolves with a string when the provided promise is resolved and the data is decrypted

#### See also: 
* `\Amp\Promise`




### `bufferWrite(string $data): \Promise Succeeds once the data has been successfully written to the stream.`

Writes data to the stream.


Parameters:
* `$data`: `string` Bytes to write.  


Return value: Succeeds once the data has been successfully written to the stream.


### `setExtra(array $data): void`

Set obfuscation keys/IVs.


Parameters:
* `$data`: `array` Keys  



### `getSocket(): \Amp\Socket\EncryptableSocket`

{@inheritdoc}


#### See also: 
* `\Amp\Socket\EncryptableSocket`




### `getStream(): \danog\MadelineProto\Stream\RawStreamInterface`

{@inheritDoc}


#### See also: 
* [`\danog\MadelineProto\Stream\RawStreamInterface`: Raw stream interface.](../RawStreamInterface.md)




### `getReadBuffer(int $length): \Amp\Promise`

Get read buffer asynchronously.


Parameters:
* `$length`: `int` Length of payload, as detected by this layer  


#### See also: 
* `\Amp\Promise`




### `getWriteBuffer(int $length, string $append): \Amp\Promise`

Get write buffer asynchronously.


Parameters:
* `$length`: `int` Total length of data that is going to be piped in the buffer  
* `$append`: `string` Data to append after entire buffer is written  


#### See also: 
* `\Amp\Promise`
